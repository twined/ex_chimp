A simple, minimalistic Mailchimp client basically for just adding members to lists.

## Installation

The package can be installed as by adding `:ex_chimp` to your list of
dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_chimp, "~> 0.0.6"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

Get all lists on your account:

```elixir
ExChimp.List.all("my_api_key")
```

Add a member to a list:

```elixir
# With merge fields
ExChimp.List.add_member(
  "my_api_key",
  "your_list_id",
  :subscribed,
  "sub@email.com",
  %{"FULL_NAME" => "Full name"}
)

# Update member
ExChimp.List.add_member(
  "my_api_key",
  "your_list_id",
  :subscribed,
  "sub@email.com",
  %{"FULL_NAME" => "New Name"}
)

# With merge fields and gdpr switch
ExChimp.List.add_member(
  "my_api_key",
  "your_list_id",
  :subscribed,
  "sub@email.com",
  %{"FULL_NAME" => "Full name"},
  %{"marketing_permissions" => [%{marketing_permission_id: "bb4ae547e5", enabled: true}]}
)

# To get the `marketing_permission_id` you can add a dummy member and extract from the `marketing_permissions` key in the response:
ExChimp.List.add_member("my_api_key", "your_list_id", :subscribed, "dummy@email.com")

# Without
ExChimp.List.add_member("my_api_key", "your_list_id", :subscribed, "sub@email.com")

# Destroy member
ExChimp.List.destroy_member("my_api_key", "your_list_id", "member@to.destroy.com")
```

## Mix tasks

To show lists on your account:

    $ mix exchimp.lists
    $ mix exchimp.lists my_api_key
